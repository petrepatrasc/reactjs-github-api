# ReactJS GitHub API

A simple project in which I try to learn more about the ReactJS framework.

As goals for this project, any site visitor should be able to fill in the username of a GitHub user and they will receive a listing of:

* The profile picture for that account.
* Public personal information for that account.
* A list of public repositories that a user has contributed to.
* A list of organisations that the user is a public member of.

In terms of technology stack, ReactJS will be used using the uni-directional data-flow described in the Flux pattern.
